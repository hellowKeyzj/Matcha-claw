/**
 * Unified gate for the cron scheduling system. Combines the build-time
 * `feature('AGENT_TRIGGERS')` flag (dead code elimination) with the runtime
 * `tengu_kairos_cron` GrowthBook gate on a 5-minute refresh window.
 *
 * AGENT_TRIGGERS is independently shippable from KAIROS — the cron module
 * graph (cronScheduler/cronTasks/cronTasksLock/cron.ts + the three tools +
 * /loop skill) has zero imports into src/assistant/ and no feature('KAIROS')
 * calls. The REPL.tsx kairosEnabled read is safe:
 * kairosEnabled is unconditionally in AppStateStore with default false, so
 * when KAIROS is off the scheduler just gets assistantMode: false.
 *
 * Called from Tool.isEnabled() (lazy, post-init) and inside useEffect /
 * imperative setup, never at module scope — so the disk cache has had a
 * chance to populate.
 *
 * The default is `true` — /loop is GA (announced in changelog). GrowthBook
 * is disabled for Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry and when DISABLE_TELEMETRY /
 * CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC are set; a `false` default would
 * break /loop for those users (GH #31759). The GB gate now serves purely as
 * a fleet-wide kill switch — flipping it to `false` stops already-running
 * schedulers on their next isKilled poll tick, not just new ones.
 *
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON` is a local override that wins over GB.

 *
 * Defaults to `true` so Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry and DISABLE_TELEMETRY users get
 * durable cron. Does NOT consult CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON (that kills the whole
