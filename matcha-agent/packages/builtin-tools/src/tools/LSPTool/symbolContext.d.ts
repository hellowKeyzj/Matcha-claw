/**
 * Extracts the symbol/word at a specific position in a file.

 *
 * @param filePath - The file path (absolute or relative)
 * @param line - 0-indexed line number
 * @param character - 0-indexed character position on the line
 *
 * Note: This uses synchronous file I/O because it is called from
 * renderToolUseMessage (a synchronous React render function). The read is
 * wrapped in try/catch so ENOENT and other errors fall back gracefully.
 * @returns The symbol at that position, or null if extraction fails
