/**
 * Command semantics configuration for interpreting exit codes in PowerShell.
 *
 * PowerShell-native cmdlets do NOT need exit-code semantics:
 *   - Select-String (grep equivalent) exits 0 on no-match (returns $null)
 *   - Compare-Object (diff equivalent) exits 0 regardless
 *   - Test-Path exits 0 regardless (returns bool via pipeline)
 * Native cmdlets signal failure via terminating errors ($?), not exit codes.
 *
 * However, EXTERNAL executables invoked from PowerShell DO set $LASTEXITCODE,
 * and many use non-zero codes to convey information rather than failure:
 *   - grep.exe / rg.exe (Git for Windows, scoop, etc.): 1 = no match
 *   - findstr.exe (Windows native): 1 = no match
 *   - robocopy.exe (Windows native): 0-7 = success, 8+ = error (notorious!)
 *
 * Without this module, PowerShellTool throws ShellError on any non-zero exit,
 * so `robocopy` reporting "files copied successfully" (exit 1) shows as an error.
